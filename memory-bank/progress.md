[2025-04-30 07:22:37] - Applied initial Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
- Enabled RLS on tables: profiles, quiz_attempts, quiz_attempt_answers, user_progress, topics, lessons, flashcards, quizzes, questions, answers.
- Created policies allowing users to manage their own data (profiles, attempts, progress).
- Created policies allowing authenticated users read access to content (topics, lessons, etc.).
- Applied via Supabase migration 'enable_initial_rls_policies'.

[2025-04-30 07:34:18] - Successfully seeded initial data (Classical Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Optics, Quantum Physics, Thermodynamics, Special Relativity) into the 'topics' table for Supabase project 'baqkidkwjogpdjefaymg'.

[2025-04-30 07:36:23] - Deployed Supabase Edge Function 'calculate-quiz-score' (ID: 1eb34083-f5a4-4fc6-8399-1682c5100d67) for project 'baqkidkwjogpdjefaymg'. This function calculates quiz scores based on user attempts and updates the database.

[2025-04-30 07:43:08] - Integrated dynamic data fetching for individual topic pages. Modified 'app/topics/classical-mechanics/page.tsx' to fetch and display its name and description from the Supabase 'topics' table using the 'classical-mechanics' slug. Implemented loading and error states. This pattern can now be applied to other static topic pages (e.g., optics, quantum-physics).

[2025-04-30 07:52:30] - Implemented Supabase Authentication:
- Installed @supabase/ssr, @supabase/auth-ui-react, @supabase/auth-ui-shared.
- Configured Supabase client utilities for SSR (server, client, middleware).
- Created middleware for session handling.
- Added /auth page with Auth UI component.
- Added /auth/callback route handler.
- Updated Navbar to show conditional Login/Logout buttons and user state.
