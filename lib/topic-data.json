    "slug": "electromagnetism",
    "name": "Electromagnetism",
    "description": "Electromagnetism is a branch of physics involving the study of the electromagnetic force, a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles. It is one of the four fundamental interactions in nature, along with the strong interaction, the weak interaction, and gravitation."

    "name": "Optics",
    "description": "Optics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior and properties of light, including its interactions with matter and the construction of instruments that use or detect it. It includes the study of sight, the sense of seeing."

    "slug": "quantum-physics",
    "name": "Quantum Physics",
    "description": "Quantum physics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles. It explains phenomena that classical physics cannot, such as wave-particle duality and quantum entanglement."

    "name": "Special Relativity",
    "description": "Special relativity is a theory of the structure of spacetime proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905. It is based on two postulates: the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another, and the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or the motion of the light source."

    "slug": "thermodynamics",
    "name": "Thermodynamics",
    "description": "Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy, radiation, and physical properties of matter. It describes how thermal energy is converted to and from other forms of energy and how it affects matter."
